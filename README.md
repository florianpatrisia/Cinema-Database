During this project, I designed and implemented a relational database dedicated to managing detailed information about a
cinema. For each entity in the database, I developed and implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), thus
ensuring the complete functionality of the data management system. Additionally, I designed and managed specialized
functions for validating the entered data, ensuring their integrity and coherence within the database. To facilitate data access
and analysis, I created reports using views, providing users with the ability to access information in a structured and easily
understandable manner.
